###A Tool Set for Everyday Reading and Writing in Console only
>In console, you put your fingure on mouse, you lose.

Seriously, this tool set is just to satisfy personal ambitious
to write down an idea in code **immediately** no mater how stupid it is.
You can use/modify it without my permission.
Feedback is welcome all the time.
Fork/Pull request is even better.

##### Idea
1. ~~Need to accept space in **edict** ok, use argparse module will solve the problem~~ 2014-06-07
2. Add language(c/c++) reference check util, hum, **cdict** maybe?
3. ~~You will need phonetic symbol in **edict**~~ 2014-05-30 12:47:45
4. I am thinking of consulting multiple pdf file in real time.
5. ~~**enews**~~ Now you have taipei times, it's ok for headline read.
6. **jnews**
7. ~~**google** google consult~~ now you can google until ajax api is ceased.
8. **gmailReader**
9. Adopt python module argparse...40% ...actually I want to keep my old fashion way in one of tool
10. Adopt python module logging...40%
11. ~~wiki~~ done!, it looks ugly for showing.
12. maybe read PDF text?
13. make a urban English consulting utility
14. osx can use 'say' to do TTS
15. ~~A lyrics search utility~~
16. ~~TED script fetch~~ done! 2014-06-05 15:46:00
17. A stackoverflow console search
18. get\_Lyrics should work with moc, music on console
19. some remark feature in reading would be amazing.
20. a loop for multiple consulting would be handy (edict/jdict)
21. a console showing mechanism that input country name and show world map.
22. output aozora style text of all Japanese text, because I need Hiragana mark.
23. make get\_ted\_talk\_science become get\_ted\_talk and list all possible when user is not input category
24. ~~write a linux kernel downloader~~ It could be more nerdy, if I fetch more version.
25. ~~remove note database to dropbox folder.~~ I just put a option in install.sh it works.
26. expand color!
27. google img fetcher. 
prototype A. download 9 images once B. combine them as 1 3x3 big image C. display them D. downloadable for each one.

##### Note
1. Plan to use jNlp
>Maybe just use hiraganamegane
2. Currently all pull, any push utility like blog push maybe?
3. Just dont't push so frequently.
